# Project Euler 063 - Powerful Digit Counts

The 5-digit number, 16807=7<sup>5</sup>, is also a fifth power.  Similarly, the 9-digit number, 134217728=8<sup>9</sup>, is a ninth power.

How many positive integers are of length n and an nth power?

## UX

**Getting Started**

Select Show Solution to Show the Solution.  Select Hide Solution to Hide the Solution.  When the solution is shown, the number of positive integers of length 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 21 are given.

**User Stories**

As a user, I can show or hide the solution by selecting the appropriate button.
